# Basic Sentence Construction

The system for constructing sentences in this language does not differ too heavily from English outside of two major aspects. First, the subject verb pair goes at the end of the clause. Like how Yoda speaks. 

- Example:
    - I have read the book = Su sluu, ye’sliip’rere.
    - I went to the market = Pu su merd, ye’van’do.
    - I work at the bookstore = On su merd’suu, ye’woik’re.

Second, is that adverbs/adjectives go *****after***** the verb/noun they are modifying.

- Example:
    - The red ball = Su tiff rob
    - The blue ball = Su tiff tre
    - I ran quickly = Ye’par’do pinte

Other than that there aren’t any major departures.

- Example sentences:
    - I went to the market to buy a pair of shoes. = Pu su merd comp e pal’i, ye’van’do.
